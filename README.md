This project is the result of a self-imposed challenge: I wanted to see if I could design and build a fully functioning task manager application in just a few weeks while learning new technologies along the way.

The application is being built using the PERN stack:

PostgreSQL – for database management

Express.js – for the backend API

React – for the frontend interface

Node.js – for the server runtime

The goal of this project is not only to create a useful tool, but also to deepen my understanding of full-stack web development, deployment workflows, and best practices across the stack.

This is still a work in progress – stay tuned for updates as the app evolves!
